Assignment 19
Create a new repository
Write a Ruby script that uses the Rails ActiveSupport gem, installed via a Gemfile and bundler
The script should do the following when run:

Show the date of the beginning of the current week
Show what the date will be in 30 days
Show what day of the week today's date will fall on next year
Show what day of the week the user's birthday will be on this year (don't forget to ask for it!)
Using the String class, pluralize a singular word the user enters and show the singular for a plural word the user enters
Using the String class, truncate a phrase the user enters to 20 letters
Using the Array class, convert an array of three words to a sentence with one command
You'll need the following Rails extensions that come with ActiveSupport:

http://api.rubyonrails.org/v4.0.3/classes/Date.html
http://api.rubyonrails.org/v4.0.3/classes/String.html
http://api.rubyonrails.org/v4.0.3/classes/Array.html
http://api.rubyonrails.org/v4.0.3/classes/Numeric.html
